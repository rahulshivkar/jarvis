This Python script creates a voice assistant named "Jarvis" that can perform various tasks based on voice commands. It uses the `pyttsx3` library for text-to-speech conversion, enabling Jarvis to respond verbally to the user. The `speech_recognition` library is employed to convert spoken words into text, allowing the assistant to process and understand voice commands. Jarvis starts by greeting the user appropriately based on the time of day and then continuously listens for commands in a loop. Depending on the recognized keywords, Jarvis can perform tasks such as searching Wikipedia for a brief summary, opening websites like YouTube, Google, or Stack Overflow, playing music from a predefined directory, announcing the current time, opening applications like Visual Studio Code, or even sending emails through the `smtplib` library. 

The program features error handling for unrecognized commands and email-sending issues. However, to enable email functionality, valid credentials must replace placeholders in the script, and for Gmail, app-specific passwords might be required. Additionally, the paths for the music directory and applications must be updated to align with the userâ€™s system. This script demonstrates a straightforward implementation of a personal voice assistant and serves as a foundation for incorporating more advanced functionalities.
